The __Discipleship Training School (DTS)__ is [YWAM’s](https://www.ywam.org) six month entry level course, embodying YWAM’s mission to know God and make Him known. DTS provides an environment for students to personally encounter Jesus Christ, learn to hear God’s voice, and respond with joy!

At the completion of the classroom phase, students have the opportunity to **make God known** in the outreach phase. The Gospel comes alive as students step out in faith to preach the good news, baptize new believers and heal the sick (Mark 16:15-18). Outreach is an exhilarating time of risk and adventure, as teams serve with local believers: transforming lives and impacting society with the love of Jesus Christ.
